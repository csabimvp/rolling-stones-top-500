('Harry Styles', 'The lead single from Harry Styles’ third album balances its agitated inner monologue, where the shape-shifting pop star picks at the details of a relationship in crisis, with spun-sugar synths that give cover to his torment. From its playful opening — Styles’ goddaughter Ruby giggling “Go on, Harry, we want to say goodnight to you!” — to its singsong bridge, during which Styles’ thoughts are ping-ponging around his head at “high-speed internet” velocities, “As It Was” paints an unusually vivid picture. Everything might seem fine on first glance, but it all becomes more troubling (“What kind of pills are you on?”) with each repeated glimpse.', 500, 2022, 'As It Was', 'track', 'Thomas Hull, Tyler Johnson, Harry Styles', '4Dvkj6JhhA12EX05fT7y2e', '5r36AJ6VOJtp00oxSkBZ5h', ARRAY['6KImCVD70vtIoJWnq6nGn3']),
('Townes Van Zandt', 'An epic story-song about a bandit and the friend who betrays him, “Pancho and Lefty” became a country hit thanks to Willie Nelson and Merle Haggard’s 1983 duet. But it’s the songwriter’s own forlorn reading, on 1972’s The Late Great Townes Van Zandt, that best conveys the doomed fates of the main characters. It begins with what might be one of the most descriptive opening verses in the country-folk canon: “Living on the road my friend/was gonna keep you free and clean/now you wear your skin like iron/your breath as hard as kerosene.” “It’s hard to take credit for the writing,” Van Zandt said in 1984, “because it came from out of the blue.”', 499, 1972, 'Pancho and Lefty', 'track', 'Townes Van Zandt', '42Wb5T7YmdrzVD81cUWWAg', '6P6cuyU2h29gN2shvuF2tO', ARRAY['3ZWab2LEVkNKiBPIClTwof']),

She had to tack on a writing credit to British singer Mina Lioness, who had tweeted its iconic line “I just took a DNA test, turns out I’m 100 percent that bitch,” but the power of this gale-force breakup banger was pure Lizzo, uproariously swaggering and endearingly soulful. “Truth Hurts” was originally released in 2017, but the song got a big boost two years later, when Gina Rodriguez day-drunkenly sang it in the Netflix show Someone Great, and it became Lizzo’s signature hit.', 498, 2017, 'Truth Hurts', 'track', 'Eric Frederic, Amina Patrice, Bogle-Barriteau, Melissa Jefferson, Steven Cheungjesse Saint John', '5qmq61DAAOUaW8AUo8xKhh', '74gSdSHe71q7urGWMMn3qB', ARRAY['56oDRnqbIiwx4mymNEv7dS']),

Just who is so vain that he probably thinks the song is about him? Simon previously revealed that actor Warren Beatty inspired the second verse of the song (“Oh, you had me several years ago/When I was still naive”), but speculation abounds regarding the other man (or men) behind the ire.

If you do a ballad first, and then a rocker, that doesn’t work.” Her instincts were right: Following the jaunty “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” “Time” became her first Number One.', 495, 1983, 'Time After Time', 'track', 'Cyndi Lauper, Rob Hyman', '7o9uu2GDtVDr9nsR7ZRN73', '1FvdZ1oizXwF9bxogujoF0', ARRAY['2BTZIqw0ntH9MvilQ3ewNY']),

According to pianist Bill Evans, the trumpeter worked up his material just hours before recording dates, but the all-star band here sounds like it’s been living with “So What” for years: Saxophonists John Coltrane and Cannonball Adderley turn in solos that have since become as iconic as any in jazz history, and the rhythm section of Evans, bassist Paul Chambers, and drummer Jimmy Cobb swings like it’s dancing on air.', 492, 1959, 'So What', 'track', 'Miles Davis', '72V4XWH3GqohTbSCMubOPP', '5y4Z6TuBVvYRkTET0zE8Fm', ARRAY['0kEfub5RzlZOB2zGomqVSU']),
('Bad Bunny', '“Tití Me Preguntó” is a showcase for Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny’s unbridled creativity and eccentric pop genius, mixing  frantic dembow beats, a classy sample by bachata master Anthony Santos, and a coda with a dash of Latin psychedelia to the global mainstream. He does it all with panache and a healthy sense of humor. Using the archetype of the concerned Latin American aunt asking about her nephew’s potential girlfriends as a starting point, he launches into a hilarious tirade of salacious puns to a bouncy party vibe that — in typical Bad Bunny fashion — unexpectedly morphs into moody self-reflection.', 491, 2022, 'Titi Me Pregunto', 'track', 'MAG, Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio', '1IHWl5LamUGEuP4ozKQSXZ', '3RQQmkQEvNCY4prGKE6oc5', ARRAY['4q3ewBCX7sLwd24euuV69X']),

Wayne initially had grand plans for “A Milli”: He wanted to use the instrumental as skits for rappers like Tyga, Hurricane Chris, Corey Gunz, and Lil Mama.

The opening riff was supposedly taken from some Morse-code producer David Bowie had heard on the Armed Forces Network.

Over Waddy Wachtel’s distinctive 16th-note guitar riff, later sampled by Destiny’s Child, Nicks sang about innocence and loss, moved by the recent deaths of an uncle and John Lennon.

And I’d play. In the dark. ‘Hello darkness my old friend/I’ve come to talk with you again.’” Simon and Garfunkel’s original acoustic version of “The Sound of Silence” was a commercial dud, but when producer Tom Wilson added electric instrumentation (without the duo’s knowledge), it became a folk-rock smash.

Elton took his words and transformed them into a soaring anthem that became his second Top 10 hit, following “Your Song.” “It had an acoustic guitar on it, it was a different song for me — it was a simpler sound,” he told Rolling Stone. “I’d moved into a house, I was becoming successful, I was so confident, musically.”', 149, 1972, 'Rocket Man', 'track', 'Elton John, Bernie Taupin', '2njsKDwQpKtVKVUt2VwxP2', '3mjiDXrYgx8u0DuqNdWHY1', ARRAY['5bHjVR4F2Tfq4Ha6x7K6wU']),

The truly brilliant turn, though, was contrasting apocalyptically afflicted verses and an angelic chorus, belted by lead Top Levi Stubbs, sounding like he’d drag himself over broken glass for the one he loved. “Eddie [Holland] realized that when Levi hit the top of his vocal range, it sounded like someone hurting, so he made him sing right up there,” the Tops’ Duke Fakir once said. “You could hear the tears in his voice.”', 78, 1967, 'Reach Out I ll Be There', 'track', 'Brian Holland, Eddie Holland, Lamont Dozier', '6Pkj4nv5K53i64cLVgkVyY', '4Jw0RycAqlXeAoymbc0CYp', ARRAY['7fIvjotigTGWqjIz6EP1i4']),

Soon after coming out of the closet — still a rarity in R&B at the time — Ocean had a hit with the falsetto slow jam “Thinkin Bout You.” He mixes up genres and vocal personae, with guest shots from André 3000 to John Mayer.

His music had a smattering of grunge, a plateful of Led Zeppelin III (check the fierce rocker “Eternal Life”), and an opulent sense of tragedy.

('Fleetwood Mac', 'With Rumours, Fleetwood Mac turned private turmoil into gleaming, melodic public art. The band’s two couples — bassist John McVie and singer-keyboard player Christine McVie, who were married; guitarist Lindsey Buckingham and vocalist Stevie Nicks, who were not — broke up during the protracted sessions for the album. As John later told Rolling Stone of the atmosphere during the making of Rumours, “Parties going on all over the house. Amazing. Terrifying. Huge amounts of illicit materials, yards and yards of this wretched stuff. Days and nights would just go on and on.”', 7, 1977, 'Rumours', 'album', 'Warner Bros.', '', '1bt6q2SruMsBtcerNVtpZB', ARRAY['08GQAI4eElDnROBrJRGE0X']),
('Nirvana', 'An overnight-success story of the 1990s, Nirvana’s second album and its totemic ﬁrst single, “Smells Like Teen Spirit,” shot up from the Northwest underground — the nascent grunge scene in Seattle — to kick Michael Jackson’s Dangerous off the top of the Billboard charts and blow hair metal off the map. Few albums have had such an overpowering impact on a generation — a nation of teens suddenly turned punk — and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator. The weight of success led already-troubled singer-guitarist Kurt Cobain to take his own life in 1994.', 6, 1991, 'Nevermind', 'album', 'Geffen', '', '2UJcKiJxNryhL050F5Z1Fk', ARRAY['6olE6TJLqED3rqDCT0FyPh']),
('The Beatles', '“It was a very happy record,” said producer George Martin, describing this album in The Beatles Anthology. “I guess it was happy because everybody thought it was going to be the last.” Indeed, Abbey Road — recorded in two months during the summer of 1969 — almost never got made at all. That January, the Beatles were on the verge of a breakup, exhausted and angry with one another after the disastrous sessions for the aborted Get Back LP, later salvaged as Let It Be [see No. 342]. Yet determined to go out with the same glory with which they had ﬁrst entranced the world at the start of the decade, the group reconvened at EMI’s Abbey Road Studios to make their most polished album: a collection of superb songs cut with an attention to reﬁned detail, then segued together (especially on Side Two) with conceptual force.', 5, 1969, 'Abbey Road', 'album', 'Apple', '', '0ETFjACtuP2ADo6LFhL6HN', ARRAY['3WrFJ7ztbogyGnTHbHJFl2']),
('Stevie Wonder', 'Months before the recording sessions for Songs in the Key of Life ended, the musicians in Stevie Wonder’s band had T-shirts made up that proclaimed, “We’re almost finished.” It was the stock answer to casual fans and Motown executives and everybody who’d fallen in love with Wonder’s early-Seventies gems – 1972’s Talking Book, 1973’s Innervisions, and 1974’s Fulfillingness’ First Finale – and who had been waiting two years for the next chapter. “I believed there was a lot that needed to be said,” Wonder said. More, in fact, than he could fit onto a double album – also included was a bonus EP, a seven-inch single with four more songs from the sessions.', 4, 1976, 'Songs in the Key of Life', 'album', 'Tamla/Motown', '', '6YUCc2RiXcEKS9ibuZxjt0', ARRAY['7guDJrEfX3qb6FEbdPA5qi']),
('Joni Mitchell', 'In 1971, Joni Mitchell represented the West Coast feminine ideal — celebrated by Robert Plant as “a girl out there with love in her eyes and flowers in her hair” on Led Zeppelin’s “Goin’ to California.” It was a status that Mitchell hadn’t asked for and did not want: “I went, ‘Oh, my God, a lot of people are listening to me,’” she recalled in 2013. “’They better find out who they’re worshiping. Let’s see if they can take it. Let’s get real.’ So I wrote Blue.”', 3, 1971, 'Blue', 'album', 'Reprise', '', '1vz94WpXDVYIEGja8cjFNa', ARRAY['5hW4L92KnC6dX9t7tYM4Ve']),
('The Beach Boys', '“Who’s gonna hear this shit?” Beach Boys singer Mike Love asked the band’s resident genius, Brian Wilson, in 1966, as Wilson played him the new songs he was working on. “The ears of a dog?” Confronted with his bandmate’s contempt, Wilson made lemonade of lemons. “Ironically,” he observed, “Mike’s barb inspired the album’s title.”', 2, 1966, 'Pet Sounds', 'album', 'Capitol', '', '2CNEkSE8TADXRT2AzcEt1b', ARRAY['3oDbviiivRWhXwIE8hxkVV']),
('Marvin Gaye', 'Marvin Gaye’s masterpiece began as a reaction to police brutality. In May 1969, Renaldo “Obie” Benson, the Four Tops’ bass singer, watched TV coverage of hundreds of club-wielding cops breaking up the People’s Park, a protest hub in Berkeley. Aghast at the violence, Benson began to write a song with Motown lyricist Al Cleveland, trying to capture the confusion and pain of the times. He knew he had something big in his nascent version of “What’s Going On,” but the rest of the Four Tops weren’t interested, and Benson’s efforts to get Joan Baez to record it didn’t work out, either.', 1, 1971, 'What s Going On', 'album', 'Tamla/Motown', '', '2v6ANhWhZBUKkg6pJJBs3B', ARRAY['3koiLjNrgRTNbOwViDipeA']);
